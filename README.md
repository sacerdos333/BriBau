# Hi There

<|--

# I am currently working on all things Github, trying to graduate to an intermediate level user. 🎉

# In my history of coding I have created projects using VBA, Python and DAX. I am currently learning C, C++, C#, PHP, Java, and Ruby. Not perticularly in that order. 🧩

# I am looking to collaborate on projects that use Python or Java. ✍

# I am looking for help with learning materials on HTML. 🕸

# When I am not coding I enjoy getting invloved with the local community, Outdoor activities, Gaming, Veteran support, and watching TV shows. 🫡

# I love this open source collaboration and hope the ease of use here in this environment keeps me passionate about learning to code. 💭
